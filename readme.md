# 🚀 Daily Coding Challenges

Welcome to my **Daily Problem Solving Repository** — a collection of coding challenges I complete each day to strengthen my problem-solving, logic, and algorithmic thinking skills.

This project includes challenges from topics such as **algorithms**, **data structures**, **math**, **logic building**, and themed weeks like **World Space Week** — where each problem connects coding with real-world scientific concepts.

---

## 🌟 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- ✅ Build consistent **daily coding habits**
- 🧠 Strengthen understanding of **core programming concepts**
- 💡 Practice writing **clean, readable, and efficient code**
- 🪐 Explore creative **theme-based problems** (like Space Week)
- 🧾 Document each problem with a **clear explanation and example tests**

---

## 🧰 Topics Covered

Each challenge focuses on a specific skill area, such as:

- **Strings & Pattern Matching** (e.g., Password Strength Checker)  
- **Arrays & Loops** (e.g., Caught Speeding, Phone Home)  
- **Math & Logic** (e.g., Perfect Square, Decimal to Binary)  
- **Data Handling** (e.g., CSV Header Parser)  
- **Applied Science / Themed Problems** (e.g., Stellar Classification for Space Week)

## 📅 Current Series: *World Space Week*

A 7-day series of astronomy-themed coding challenges, including:
1. **Stellar Classification** – Categorizing stars by temperature.  
2. **[Day 2 Placeholder]** – (Coming soon).  
3. **Phone Home** – Calculating signal delay between satellites.  
4-7. More daily space-related problems coming soon!

## 🧪 Format of Each Problem

Each challenge folder or section contains:
- **🧩 Problem Statement** — concise explanation of the task.  
- **🧮 Example Test Cases** — with expected outputs.  
- **✅ Key Points** — what concepts the challenge reinforces.  
- **🎯 Goal** — why it matters and what it practices.

---

## 🧭 How I Use This Project

- I treat each problem as a **daily warm-up** before working on larger projects.  
- Every README is written to simulate a **learning notebook**, showing both the problem and my reasoning.  
- Over time, this repository becomes a **personal study log** — tracking growth, creativity, and technical fluency.

---

## 🪐 Future Plans

- Add **solution files** for each challenge (in JavaScript and Python).  
- Expand beyond Space Week into other themes like:
  - 🌊 *Ocean Exploration Week*
  - ⚙️ *Engineering Logic Week*
  - 🧩 *Algorithm Marathon Week*

## 💬 Closing Note

> “Solving one small problem every day sharpens the mind like a telescope —  
> each lens you polish brings the bigger picture into focus.”

By tackling these daily challenges, I’m not just learning to code —  
I’m learning to **think, reason, and create like a problem solver.**
