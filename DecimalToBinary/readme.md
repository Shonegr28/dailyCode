# ğŸ”¢ Decimal to Binary

This project converts a **non-negative integer** into its **binary representation** as a string.

## ğŸ“Œ Problem Statement
- A binary number uses only the digits `0` and `1` to represent values.  
- To convert decimal to binary:  
  1. Repeatedly divide the number by 2.  
  2. Record the remainder each time.  
  3. Continue until the number becomes 0.  
  4. The binary representation is the remainders read **from last to first**.  

Example: Convert `12` to binary
