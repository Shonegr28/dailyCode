## ðŸ“– Rules for Building the Acronym  

1. **Capitalize** the first letter of each word.  
2. **Ignore common small words** â€” skip the first letter of the words:  
   - `a`, `an`, `and`, `by`, `for`, `of`  
   (unless they are the **first word** in the string).  
3. **Preserve order** â€” letters appear in the order the words are given.  
4. **No spaces** â€” the final acronym is a continuous string of letters.
