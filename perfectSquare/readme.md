# ðŸ”¢ Perfect Square

This project checks whether a given integer is a **perfect square**.  
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as an integer multiplied by itself.  

For example:  
- `9` is a perfect square because `3 Ã— 3 = 9`.  
- `16` is a perfect square because `4 Ã— 4 = 16`.  
- `2` is **not** a perfect square.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Given an integer, determine if it is a perfect square.

Return:
- **true** if the number is a perfect square.  
- **false** otherwise.

## ðŸ§ª Example Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output |
|-------|-----------------|
| isPerfectSquare(9) | true |
| isPerfectSquare(49) | true |
| isPerfectSquare(1) | true |
| isPerfectSquare(2) | false |
| isPerfectSquare(99) | false |
| isPerfectSquare(-9) | false |
| isPerfectSquare(0) | true |
| isPerfectSquare(25281) | true |

## âœ… Key Points
- Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares.  
- Zero (`0`) is considered a perfect square (`0 Ã— 0 = 0`).  
- Large numbers may also be perfect squares.  
- The goal is to practice working with integers and mathematical properties.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
This exercise builds problem-solving skills by applying mathematical reasoning to check if a number is a perfect square.
